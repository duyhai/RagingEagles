This project was started by Mate Szabo and me in 2010, but it got abandoned over time. Had too much work with university and it was really hard as we did not know much about game programming. As it dragged out our motivation started decreasing and got abandoned after a while. Now that there is the news of the fall of flash everywhere, there is not much motivation to continue it. Might decide to finish it in HTML5.
